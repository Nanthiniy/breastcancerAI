# General Breast Cancer Information

what causes breast cancer|Breast cancer can be caused by genetic mutations, hormonal factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences.
is breast cancer painful|Not always. Early breast cancer may not cause pain, but in advanced stages, pain may occur due to tumor growth or metastasis.

# Breast Cancer Stages
what are the stages of breast cancer|Breast cancer is classified into **Stage 0 (non-invasive)** to **Stage IV (metastatic)** based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and spread to other organs.
what is stage 0 breast cancer|Stage 0 breast cancer, also called **Carcinoma in Situ**, means cancerous cells are present but have not spread to surrounding tissues.
what is stage 1 breast cancer|Stage 1 is **early-stage breast cancer**, where the tumor is small and has minimal or no lymph node involvement.
what is stage 2 breast cancer|Stage 2 is a larger tumor or one that has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant organs.
what is stage 3 breast cancer|Stage 3 is considered **locally advanced cancer**, meaning it has spread extensively in the breast and lymph nodes but not to distant organs.
what is stage 4 breast cancer|Stage 4, or **metastatic breast cancer**, means the cancer has spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body like bones, lungs, liver, or brain.

# Symptoms and Diagnosis
what are the symptoms of breast cancer|Symptoms include a lump in the breast, nipple discharge, changes in breast shape, skin dimpling, and persistent breast pain.
how do i check for breast cancer at home|You can perform **breast self-exams** by feeling for lumps or changes in breast shape, size, or skin texture. However, professional screening is recommended.
how is breast cancer diagnosed|Breast cancer is diagnosed using **mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, and biopsies** to check for cancerous cells.
what is a mammogram|A **mammogram** is an X-ray imaging technique used to detect breast cancer at an early stage.

# Risk Factors and Prevention
what increases the risk of breast cancer|Risk factors include **age, genetic mutations (BRCA1 & BRCA2), hormone therapy, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise**.
can breast cancer be prevented|While not entirely preventable, you can **reduce risk** by maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, exercising, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol.
does breastfeeding reduce breast cancer risk|Yes! **Breastfeeding has been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer**, as it lowers hormone levels that can trigger cancer growth.
is breast cancer hereditary|Yes, mutations in genes like **BRCA1 and BRCA2** can be inherited, increasing the risk of breast cancer.

# Treatment and Side Effects
what are the treatments for breast cancer|Treatment includes **surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy**, depending on the cancer stage.
what is chemotherapy for breast cancer|Chemotherapy uses **powerful drugs** to kill cancer cells, often used in advanced stages or aggressive types of breast cancer.
what is radiation therapy for breast cancer|Radiation therapy uses **high-energy rays** to destroy cancer cells, typically after surgery to prevent recurrence.
what are the side effects of chemotherapy|Common side effects include **nausea, hair loss, fatigue, weakened immune system, and mouth sores**.
how long does breast cancer treatment last|Treatment duration varies from **a few months to several years**, depending on the stage and type of therapy used.
can breast cancer come back after treatment|Yes, breast cancer can **recur**, which is why regular follow-ups and screenings are important even after successful treatment.

is exercise good for breast cancer patients|Yes, **regular exercise** can improve energy levels, reduce treatment side effects, and lower the risk of recurrence.
can stress cause breast cancer|Stress alone does not directly cause breast cancer, but chronic stress may weaken the immune system and contribute to unhealthy behaviors.

# Survival Rates and Prognosis
what are the survival rates for breast cancer|Survival rates depend on the stage. **Early-stage breast cancer (Stage 1 & 2) has a high survival rate**, while Stage 4 has a lower survival rate.
is stage 4 breast cancer curable|Stage 4 breast cancer is not typically curable, but **treatment can help manage symptoms and prolong life**.

# Common Misconceptions
can wearing a bra cause breast cancer|No, **there is no scientific evidence** linking bra-wearing to breast cancer.
does deodorant cause breast cancer|No, research has not found **any direct link between antiperspirants and breast cancer**.
does sugar feed breast cancer|While cancer cells consume glucose, **there is no direct evidence that sugar alone causes or worsens breast cancer**.

# Miscellaneous Questions
can men get breast cancer|Yes, **men can develop breast cancer**, though it is much rarer than in women.
can young women get breast cancer|Yes, while breast cancer is more common in older women, **young women can also develop it, especially if they have genetic risk factors**.
